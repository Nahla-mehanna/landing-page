# Landing Page Project

This is my first web development project ever.
I hope you like it and I will be happy to hear your suggestions and advice to learn from you and become better Web developer.




## Instructions


I used one main function with for of loop to do almost everything to make my code less complicated.
My idea was to make all the project requirements with less complicated easy to understand small lines of code.

Also I added fragment for performance.



I selected all the sections using querySelectorAll .
Then created main function with the for of loop to create :
* Li lists
* a ( anchor)
Added to each a(anchor) :
* Class
* href
* Text Content
* Add event listener


Also if statement with the getBoundingClientRect to add the class (your-active-class) if the section is in the view port.
if the section is not in the view port remove the class (your-active-class) .

And i added one extra thing from the suggestions which is the scroll to the top button.
